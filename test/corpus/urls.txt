Hello.

You might find my web site at https://andrewdupont.net.

One example would be [this one](http://example.com/foo?bar=baz)

Or this one [http://example.com]

But not this fragment http://
But this one is OK http://x

@import url(https://www.example.com/style.css);

div {
  background-image: url("https://www.example.com/style.gif");
}

Terminal parenthesis (paired)

Sorry, Elvis: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_(song) (because the closing parenthesis is mistakenly assumed not to be part of the URL. Eventually, I hope, Tree-sitter will allow me to make assertions about specific row/column ranges; until then, this test merely confirms that we recognize a URL here and do not have an error)
